# Docker Clone

My philosophy regarding technology is if I don't understand it, then I better try building it. 

Regardless of the results, I walk away learning something awesomeðŸ¤“

This is the repo for a Docker clone I built as a side project. 
I learned so much about the service, and I wish I was using it more heavily in previous projects. 

I was inspired to do this from a former classmate of mine, and I conducted further research into it by perusing documentation.

Took quite a bit of time, but I'm immensely proud of the knowledge I gained from this. 

Here's what the project is:
 
 - A *very* lightweight version of docker
 - Controlled via the command line. No fancy GUIs here and many key features of Docker are not included
 - It does utilize some fundamental key features of Docker such as process isolation, 
   filesystem isolation, handling exit codes, and etc.

Here's what it's NOT:
 - Actual Docker
